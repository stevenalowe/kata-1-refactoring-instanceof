INSTRUCTIONS FOR STEP 6

    6. change API, adjust callers

Polymorphism achievement unlocked!

We've eliminated the last of our 'scaffolding' methods (the methods we introduced while we changed the structure of the code) and are now using polymorphism to great effect.

So far, all of our changes have been isolated from the rest of the system. Unfortunately, in this last step we can no longer hide what we are doing; instead we must proudly broadcast it to the world.

In other words, we have to change our public interface from
    generateFlatFormatRecordForShopEvent(Object obj)
to
    generateFlatFormatRecordForShopEvent(ShopEvent shopEvent)

And deal with changes in the calling code, if any.

TO DO

Change generateFlatFormatRecordForShopEvent to take a ShopEvent argument instead of an object. Eliminate the last instanceof usage. Rejoice.
