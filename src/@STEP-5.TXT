INSTRUCTIONS FOR STEP 5

    5. call via polymorphism

We already have polymorphism in play from the last refactoring step, but it's obscured by the extracted method.

Let's eliminate that method now that we no longer need it.

(I don't know about you, but I get a kick out of deleting code and seeing everything still work!)

I know it doesn't seem like much, but we have succeeded in covering all shop-event domain classes with a single instanceof test and cast (to the base class). Consider the effect this would have had if we had 16 domain classes instead of just two: we remove all instanceof conditions except the one on the base class.

This step is small but powerful: it "covers" all of the other instanceof conditions and casts, eliminating all but one.


TO DO

Eliminate the last intermediate method and call convertToFlatFormat directly using polymorphism.
